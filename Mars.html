    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <p> Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground. There were people living on mars 3.7 billion years ago. Scientist want to know if Mars could support life now or in the future. One day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours. It is just a little longer than a day on Earth. One year on Mars is 687 Earth days. It is almost twice as long as one year on Earth. Mars has two moons. The range of the temperature is  -85°F (-65°C). If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 38 pounds on Mars. The temperature of Mars on long polar nights hits -180 F which is way too cold for any human to survive.</p>

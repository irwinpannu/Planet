    <h1>Jupiter</h1>
    <p> Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well. One day on Jupiter goes by in just 10 hours. One year on Jupiter is the same as 11.8 Earth years. Jupiter has 79 confirmed moons. The range of the temperature is  - 166°F (-110°C). If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 235 pounds on Jupiter. Jupiter is a gas giant, which means it probably does not have a solid surface, and the gas it is made up of would be toxic for us. It is also very far from the sun (sunlight can take over an hour to get there) which means that is it very cold.</p>

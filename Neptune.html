    <h1>Neptune</h1>
    <p> Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see. One day on Neptune goes by in 16 hours. Neptune has such a long journey around the Sun it takes 165 Earth years to go around once. That’s a long year!  Neptune has 14 moons. The range of the temperature is  330°F (-200°C). If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 117 pounds on Uranus. People can’t live here because the winds on Neptune are among the fastest known, peaking at 200 km/hr.</p>

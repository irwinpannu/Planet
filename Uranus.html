    <h1>Uranus</h1>
    <p> Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue. Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side. Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings. One day on Uranus lasts a little over 17 hours (17 hours and 14 minutes, to be exact). One year on Uranus is the same as 84 years on Earth. Uranus has 27 known moons. The range of the temperature is  -320°F (-195°C). If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 90 pounds on Uranus. People can't live in Uranus because there's no water there for people to survive there. Uranus's surface is about -357F and it's center is about 9000F so water cannot survive there unless there's really high pressure because the water there would become vapor or a gas. There is no such pressure on Uranus so no water in liquid form would be avaliable for living beings.</p>
